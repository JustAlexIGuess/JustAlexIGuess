- 👋 Hi, I’m @JustAlexIGuess
- 👀 I’m interested in game testing, streaming, game development, and Japanese!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning c#, QA best practices, Japanese, and how not to go crazy being locked down at my apartment (jk)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on build testing, connecting the dots with new game updates and help people track things that need to be improved
- 📫 How to reach me, email me at alexander.morillo@tangibleplay.com
